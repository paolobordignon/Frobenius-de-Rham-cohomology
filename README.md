# Frobenius on de Rham Cohomology

This project implements a SageMath-based computation of the Frobenius action on the first de Rham cohomology group \( H^1_{\mathrm{dR}} \) of a smooth curve over a \( p \)-adic field. It is inspired by algorithms for explicitly describing the Frobenius action via differential forms and reductions modulo \( p \).

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook with interactive examples and symbolic computations.

## Contents

- `Frobenius.ipynb`: Main notebook with step-by-step computations and explanatory code cells.
- `src/`: Directory for supporting Python/Sage scripts (e.g., `frobenius.py`).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Features

- Construction of \( p \)-adic power series rings
- Computation of differentials on hyperelliptic curves
- Interactive visualization of the Frobenius matrix
- Helper functions for reduction and precision control

## Project Goals

- Understand the Frobenius action in rigid cohomology via differential forms
- Provide computational tools for researchers studying \( p \)-adic Hodge theory or arithmetic geometry
- Offer a reproducible, modular, and interactive implementation
